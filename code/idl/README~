In January 2014 I published, with Sandrine Bony and Jean-Louis Dufresne, a paper providing evidence that the amount of mixing between the lower and middle troposphere controlled the strength of a positive low-cloud feedback in models (see also my Explainer of this paper in The Conversation). This paper presented a metric called LTMI, which was the sum of two measures S and D. The small-scale measure S is based on simple averages of fields in a restricted domain, and is sufficiently straightforward that I have not provided a code to calculate it.

The code I used for calculating the parameter D, and quantities used to compute resolved upward humidity and mass fluxes, can be found here. It is written in IDL. You will also need a land-sea mask data file used by the routine. This code requires only the omega field (vertical pressure velocity) but has options to compute humidity fluxes as well, in which case specific humidity data are also needed.
